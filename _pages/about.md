    <p>👨🏽‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at UNAM.</p>

    <p>🔬 My research pursuits revolve around two primary areas: crafting artificially intelligent agents leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, and devising algorithms geared towards optimization.</p>

    <p> 📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Reinforcement Learning and Multiobjective Optimization.</p>

    <p> 🤖 I'm also keen on contributing to projects in the realm of Machine Learning, particularly those focused on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.</p>

# Selected Experience

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have cultivated profound expertise in autonomous research, adeptly replicating a diverse array of papers across Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and multi-objective algorithms. Noteworthy among my accomplishments are faithful reproductions of seminal works such as:

- "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning"
- "Playing Atari with Reinforcement Learning"
- "A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II"
- "MOEA/D: A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition"
- "An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-point Based Non-dominated Sorting Approach, Part I: Solving Problems with Box Constraints"

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to communicating the paper's theory and my results.
