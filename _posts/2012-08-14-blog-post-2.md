In this blog post, we will analyze the concentration of contaminants in Mexico City from 2015 to 2023. Using data from the Mexico City government's Automated Atmospheric Monitoring Network ([RAMA](http://www.aire.cdmx.gob.mx/default.php?opc=%27aKBh%27)), this analysis aims to inform residents about the atmospheric contaminants that can impact their health and well-being. Additionally, the findings can help develop strategies to reduce air pollution and improve air quality. You can find the source code of this analysis in my [portfolio entry](https://maxgalindo150.github.io/blog/portfolio/)

#### Overview of RAMA and the Monitored Contaminants

Mexico City has a considerable number of monitoring stations that record the concentration of contaminants in the atmosphere hourly since 1986. Researchers can use this data to create and improve strategies to reduce air pollution. The RAMA database contains records of the following nine contaminants:

- `CO`: Carbon Monoxide
- `NO`: Nitrogen Monoxide
- `NO2`: Nitrogen Dioxide
- `NOX`: Nitrogen Oxides
- `O3`: Ozone
- `PM10`: Particulate Matter smaller than 10 micrometers
- `PM25`: Particulate Matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers
- `PMCO`: Coarse Fraction Particulate Matter
- `SO2`: Sulfur Dioxide

The concentration of these contaminants is registered hourly at each monitoring station distributed throughout Mexico City.

#### Yearly Trends in Contaminant Concentration

One important question we can answer is: How has the concentration of each contaminant changed from 2015 to 2023? Figure 1 shows the mean concentration of each contaminant over this period.

As seen in the graphs, most contaminants exhibit relatively constant behavior over time. However, ozone (Oâ‚ƒ) shows a slight upward trend.

Another significant observation is the drop in contaminant levels between 2020 and 2021, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that lockdowns and reduced use of cars and public transportation contributed to the decrease in contaminant concentrations. The reduction in industrial activities, fewer vehicles on the roads, and decreased energy consumption led to noticeable improvements in air quality. This period provides valuable insights into how changes in daily habits and transportation can positively affect the environment.

These findings emphasize the need for sustainable practices and policies that can maintain and further improve air quality. By promoting alternative transportation methods, encouraging remote work, and implementing stricter emissions regulations, we can work towards a healthier environment and better air quality for all.

#### Daily Trends in Contaminant Concentration

Another question we can explore is: How does contaminant concentration change over the course of a day? Figure 2 describes the variation in the concentration of each contaminant throughout the day.

Several important aspects can be observed:

1. **Fuel-burning Contaminants:** Contaminants generated by fuel combustion, such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide, show pronounced peaks between 5 and 10 in the morning, coinciding with high mobility hours in the city.

2. **Particulate Matter:** Particulate matter ($$PM_{2.5}$$, $$PM_{10}$$, and $$PM_{co}$$) also exhibits peaks during high mobility periods, specifically between 5 and 10 in the morning and between 3 and 8 in the evening. It is important to consider the high levels of $$PM_{2.5}$$ and $$PM_{10}$$, which are particles smaller than 2.5 and 10 micrometers respectively, as they have significant health implications.

3. **Ozone:** Ozone shows a peak around 3 PM, coinciding with the time of day when the highest amount of UV radiation is received. This is consistent since ozone formation is driven by UV radiation.

These observations highlight the direct relationship between human activities, such as commuting and industrial operations, and the levels of various air pollutants. The morning and late afternoon peaks are likely due to increased vehicle emissions and industrial output during these times. The data suggests that targeted measures during these peak hours could effectively reduce pollution levels.

Understanding the behavior of ozone, with its peak in the early afternoon, underscores the importance of considering natural processes, such as UV radiation, in air quality management strategies. This information can help design more effective policies to control emissions and protect public health, especially during times of day when pollutants and UV radiation are at their highest levels.

High levels of $$PM_{2.5}$$ and $$PM_{10}$$ are particularly concerning for health, as these fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, causing a range of health problems from respiratory issues to cardiovascular diseases. Recognizing the health impacts of these particles is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate their presence in the air.

By analyzing these patterns, we can better understand the dynamics of air pollution in the city and develop more precise interventions to mitigate its impact. This knowledge is crucial for creating a cleaner, healthier urban environment.


### Correlation Between Different Contaminants

We can also investigate whether there is any correlation between the levels of different contaminants. Understanding these correlations can help us better comprehend how these pollutants interact with each other and how changes in one might influence the levels of others.

Given that our data includes various nitrogen oxides ($$NO_{x}$$), it is evident that there is a correlation between them. Additionally, we observe a strong positive correlation between these nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide ($$CO$$). Generally, all the contaminants analyzed show a positive correlation, with most exceeding a coefficient of 0.5.

In contrast, ozone ($$O_{3}$$) presents a negative correlation with the other contaminants. This suggests that its formation and concentration are influenced by different factors or processes that are antagonistic to those affecting the other contaminants.

#### Detailed Analysis of Correlation

By analyzing the correlation coefficients between different contaminants, we can draw several important conclusions:

1. **Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide:** There is a strong positive correlation between nitrogen oxides ($$NO$$, $$NO_{2}$$, $$NO_{X}$$) and carbon monoxide ($$CO$$). This indicates that these pollutants often increase and decrease together, likely due to common sources such as vehicle emissions and industrial processes.

2. **Particulate Matter:** $$PM_{2.5}$$ and $$PM_{10}$$ also show positive correlations with other contaminants, reinforcing the idea that activities leading to higher particulate matter levels also contribute to higher levels of gaseous pollutants.

3. **Ozone:** The negative correlation of ozone with other pollutants, particularly during peak traffic hours, can be explained by the fact that ozone formation typically occurs through photochemical reactions involving sunlight. Therefore, while other pollutants peak during high traffic periods, ozone levels often peak in the early afternoon when sunlight is most intense.

These correlations are crucial for developing comprehensive air quality management strategies. For instance, reducing emissions from traffic and industrial sources could simultaneously lower levels of multiple pollutants. Conversely, understanding the unique behavior of ozone can help tailor specific measures to address its formation, such as limiting activities that contribute to its precursors during times of high UV radiation.

Below is the correlation matrix illustrating the relationships between different contaminants:

By considering these correlations, policymakers and environmental scientists can devise more effective strategies to control air pollution. This integrated approach is essential for protecting public health and improving air quality in urban environments.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we analyzed the concentration of various contaminants in Mexico City from 2015 to 2023, using data from the Mexico City government's Automated Atmospheric Monitoring Network (RAMA). Our analysis revealed several key insights:

1. **Yearly Trends:** Most contaminants exhibited relatively constant behavior over time, with a notable exception of ozone ($$O_{3}$$), which showed a slight upward trend. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in contaminant levels between 2020 and 2021, highlighting the impact of reduced human activity on air quality.

2. **Daily Trends:** Contaminants generated by fuel combustion, such as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, peaked during high mobility hours (5-10 AM and 3-8 PM). Particulate matter ($$PM_{2.5}$$ and $$PM_{10}$$) showed similar peaks. Ozone levels, however, peaked in the early afternoon, correlating with UV radiation levels.

3. **Correlation Analysis:** There were strong positive correlations between nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, indicating common sources like vehicle emissions. Particulate matter also showed positive correlations with other contaminants. In contrast, ozone presented a negative correlation with other pollutants, due to its unique formation process driven by sunlight.

These findings emphasize the need for targeted measures to reduce air pollution, such as promoting alternative transportation methods, encouraging remote work, and implementing stricter emissions regulations. Understanding the correlations between different pollutants can help in designing more effective air quality management strategies.

By analyzing these patterns and correlations, we gain valuable insights into the dynamics of air pollution in Mexico City. This knowledge is crucial for creating a cleaner, healthier urban environment, ultimately benefiting the health and well-being of the city's residents.
